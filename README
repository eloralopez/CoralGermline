README

This repository holds the code and some of the data used to run the analyses in:
LÃ³pez-Nandam EH, Albright R, Hanson EA, Sheets EA, Palumbi SR (2021). Mutations in coral soma and sperm imply lifelong stem cell differentiation. (in review)

In /scripts you can find the code used to process the data and generate figures.

in /genome_annotations you can find the code used to annotate the new, chromosome-level Acropora hyacinthus genome assembly.

In /datafiles you can find the .ann.txt files generated by the MatchVerifiedMutswithAnnotatedVCF.py step. These files are then read into the R scripts for further filtering to arrived at the final set of SNVs, and to generate figures (see README in /scripts for pipeline). 

The raw fastq files for this paper are accessioned at NCBI SRA under BioProject PRJNA707502 under accession numbers SAMN18207983-SAMN18208014. 

The new, chromosome-level genome assembly generated for this paper is also under BioProject PRJNA707502, with accession number [GCA_020536085.1] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_020536085.1/)
